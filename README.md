# Playing Music

When searching for music, BeatBox will search the local, or remote directory first. If the requested song isn't found, BeatBox will search SoundCloud. Songs in the local/remote directory should list artist and name in the file name. Artist and song can be seperated with a space or hyphen. When searching for a specific song, users will use artist name followed by a space and song title. See example below...

Usage:

     ?play The Beatles Helter Skelter
